# Deobfuscator Usage Instructions

To use the deobfuscator, follow these steps:

1. Download the obfuscated build from starve.io and place it in the `input` folder as `obfuscated.js`.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Execute the deobfuscator with the command `npx tsx deobfuscator`.

Please note that this deobfuscator may not work if the obfuscator used by starve.io is updated. If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue for support. It might also work with taming.io and devast.io, but this is not guaranteed.

## Currently broken, will find the issue (sometime screen is bugging)
